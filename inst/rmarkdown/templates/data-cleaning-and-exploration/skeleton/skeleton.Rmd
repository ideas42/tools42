# Executive Summary

You can use this space to explain what this report is about. What were your objectives, what you found, and how you did it.

# Project metadata:

Remember that you can change the project code and type, psychologies used, and testing design in the header. They will automatically show up here:

- **Project code:** `r rmarkdown::metadata$project_code`
- **Evaluation:** This project uses a `r stringr::str_to_upper(rmarkdown::metadata$evaluation)` strategy for testing.
- **Project type:** This is a `r stringr::str_to_upper(rmarkdown::metadata$project_type)` project. 
- **Psychologies used:** `r rmarkdown::metadata$psychologies`

# Data importing and cleaning

```{r}

library(palmerpenguins)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tools42)

data(penguins)

```

We start by taking a look at what variables we have in our dataset.


```{r}

skim(penguins)

```


Seems like there's quite a bit of continuous data. Let's plot some of it.


```{r}

penguins %>%
  viz_scatter(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm) +
  theme_42()

```

This is interesting. I wonder if there's any differences by species!

```{r}

penguins %>%
  viz_scatter(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm) +
  aes(color = species) +
  theme_42() +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette_42("i42_bright"))


```

Now, a histogram of flipper length:


```{r}

penguins %>%
  viz_hist(flipper_length_mm) +
  aes(fill = species) +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  theme_42() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_42("i42_bright"))


```
